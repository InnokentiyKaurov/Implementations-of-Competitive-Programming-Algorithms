# Implementations of Competitive Programming Algorithms
In this repository, you will find my own tested implementations of various CP algorithms.\
## Clarifications regarding the contents of files with multiple algorithms:
**BasicGeometry.cpp** contains: basic operations with points/lines/segments/rays, convex hull construction, point location in simple/convex polygons, Minkowski sum.\\
**AllBasicStringAlgo.cpp** contains: polynomial string hashing, prefix function, Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, Prefix Automaton, Z-function, Trie.\\
**GeneralDataStructures.cpp** contains: Disjoint Set Union, Sparse Table, Abstract Segment Tree, Abstract Lazy Segment Tree, Li Chao Tree.\\
